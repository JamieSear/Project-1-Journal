## Daily Standup

### Day 1
- Mugisha made a great start over the weekend with working on a 'Create' page and got the new posts to be saved to a JSON file once submitted.
- We discussed who would do what from our Google Doc plan that was created on Friday. 
- We decided to work on displaying the data from the JSON file on the 'Posts' page with Alex and Jamie focusing on communicating with the Giphy API and Mugisha and Cindy focusing on generating and storing the posts' reaction data.
- No blockers.

### Day 2
- Updated our Google Doc plan with what we had achieved yesterday and reflected upon the fact that we'd made a good start.  
- Jamie and Cindy created HTML and Figma templates of what our remaining pages were to look like.  
- Mugisha fixed a bug that stopped the page refreshing whenever we write to the JSON file.
- Alex and Jamie continued working on displaying the JSON data onto the 'Posts' page - ran into some trouble with appending the correct comment to the correct post's comment section which Mugisha managed to solve in the evening.
- Cindy made great progress on creating navbars and adding some styling to our pages as well as completing the reaction counters with Mugisha. 
- No blockers.
